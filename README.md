# Zero Speech Challenge 2017

All you need to get started for the track 1 and track 2 of the
**[Zero Speech Challenge 2017](TODO)**:

- speech data download
- evaluation software setup
- baseline and topline replication

**First of all** install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
and [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) on your system, if
not already done.


## Getting the hyper-training data

TODO We need a server and bandwidth to host raw speech data, ABX task
files and baseline features.

TODO a script *get_data.sh* with wget commands to the server. This
will create ./data/{lang1, lang2, etc...} folders with {train, test}
subfolders.


## Track 1: Unsupervised subword modeling

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:bootphon/zerospeech2017.git

### Environment setup

### Baseline reproduction

### Topline reproduction

TODO This will require [abkhazia](https://github.com/bootphon/abkhazia)



## Track 2: Spoken term discovery
