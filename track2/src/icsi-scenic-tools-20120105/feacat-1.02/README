This is the README for the "feacat" package.

"feacat" is a tool for "cat'ing" feature files, although it does many
other things as well as just copying the input to the output,
including a wide range of file format conversion funtions and subset
extraction specifiers.

Rather than having a series of special-purpose tools for converting
pairs of formats, feacat is a single universal translator for the
several formats that consist of frames of real values organized into
separate utterances.  Specifically, this encompasses both feature
files (e.g. pfiles, pre files) as well as probability files (LNAs,
rapact).  Also within the feacat package is the "labcat" program,
which does a similar things for labels.  A "linecat" utility performs
some of the cutting and pasting operations on files which are just
lines of text.  The "segpostsum" program summarizes posterior
probabilities and can be used to compare winning classes between
probability files and known-good label files.  Much of the
functuionality of feacat is provided by the QuickNet library.

See the feacat, labcat, linecat and segpostsum man pages for more
description.

See the file "INSTALL" for installation instructions.

feacat was written by Dan Ellis although there have been
several other contributors.
