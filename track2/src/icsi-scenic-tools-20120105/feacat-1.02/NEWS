 - Added some fixes for the latest version of gcc (from dpwe)

====================
=== feacat 1.01 ====
====================

 - Added the "-usedoubleslash" option so the "//" syntax for parallel
   feature files isn't enabled by default (it causes more trouble than
   it's worth!)  
 - Fixed "ascii" format so it uses %g for output and added "asciif" which
   uses the version 1.00 and before %f output.
 - Added config.sub and config.guess to dist.

====================
=== feacat 1.00 ====
====================

Changes from 0.2 include:
 - Fixed a memory read error in the fopen_gz routine that'd been sitting
   there for many years until valgrind found it.
 - Added "-tranform safelog ".

====================
=== feacat 0.2 ===
====================

This is a new version of feacat based on the previous version
nominally called 0.1 that was maintained by Dan Ellis and others.
Until version 0.2 there wasn't a news file.

Changes from 0.1 include:
 - Large file support added so will work with >32bit pfiles if linked
   with an approriate version of QuickNet.
 - Addition of the -sriftrname argument.
 - Addition of a license identical to the one included with QuickNet.
 - Now works exclusively with quicknet3 and quicknet3.pc package
   config file.
 - Addition of --with-quicknet configure argument.
 - Support for program_suffix et al added to configure
 - Usage message now includes package version number rather than RCS header.
 - Source now under CVS.
