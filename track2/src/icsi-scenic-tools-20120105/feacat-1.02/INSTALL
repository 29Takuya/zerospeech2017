This is the INSTALL file for the feacat package.

Prerequisites
=============

Fecat requires Dan Ellis's dpwelib library and the QuickNet3 MLP library.




feacat is configured under GNU Autoconf for ease of installation.  
It does, however, depend on several other pieces.  Hence, ./configure 
accepts the following specific options:

    --with-dpwelib=DIR	Where to find dpwelibConfig.sh, which is 
			needed because this package uses the dpwelib
			cle module for command-line parsing.

    --with-quicknet=DIR	Where to find the QuickNet library.
			This should point to the "lib" directory.  The
			configure script will look in lib/pkgconfig for
			the quicknet3.pc package config file.

Once you've located these, it should just be ./configure ...
then make, then make install.
