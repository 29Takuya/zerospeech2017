Install Instructions for feacalc
================================

This package needs a lot of pieces.  Build in this order:

 - get libdat.  configure.  make. (?? Still needed? ??)
 - get farray_otcl; configure it --with-dat=<dat build dir> --without-otcl. 
   It's ok that it skips the Tcl interface. make lib . (?? Still needed? ??)
 - get quicknet.  configure. make.
 - get rasta.  configure.  build librasta.a
 - get dpwelib. configure. build.

 - You can now configure feacalc:
     --with-dpwelib=<dir containing libdpwe.a, if not $exec_prefix/lib>
     --with-rastalib=<dir containing librasta.a, if not $exec_prefix/lib>
     --with-rastainc=<rasta src directory>

 - "make test" attempts to run the RASTA testsuite with a tcl wrapper 
   on feacalc that emulates rasta.  This is a pretty good test, although 
   it doesn't check feacalc-specific enhancements (like range lists etc).
