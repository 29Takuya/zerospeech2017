====================
=== feacalc 0.91 ===
====================

Version 0.91 adds one feature:
 - Added the -numFilts argumen to control the number of filters in the
   auditory filter bank (correspons to the rasta -c option)
 - Added the INSTALL-icsi file

====================
=== feacalc 0.90 ===
====================

This is a new version of feacat based on the previous version
nominally called 0.5 that was maintained by Dan Ellis and others.
Until version 0.9 there wasn't a news file.

Changes from 0.5 include:
 - Addition of --with-quicknet configure argument.
 - Usage message now includes desciption and version number.
 - Moved to use quicknet3.
 - Some documentation errors fixed.
 - Support for program_suffix et al added to configure
 - Added program-transform stuff.
 - Source now under CVS.
 - Fixed to get rid of C++ #include issues.


===================
=== feacalc 0.5 ===
===================

The following changes correspond to feacalc 0.4 and earlier and were
copied from the CHANGES file:


1998nov16 dpwe@icsi.berkeley.ed
	- configure/make now uses librasta.a rather than recompiling 
	  the rasta srcs.  Also, irasta eliminated since its one src 
	  file is now part of rasta.
	- changes to make it compile cleanly under Linux/g++
	- checks machine endianness and sets mapping of "swap" output 
	  formats into byteswap flags accordingly. -output swap means 
	  "write little-endian raw floats" now.
	- added support for psuedo-online-downsampling via FFT truncation, 
	  as has been added to RASTA.

1998apr24 dpwe@icsi.berkeley.edu
	- Realized that you couldn't use feacalc for your basic DIGITS 
	  pfile because it didn't support the 'ranged' indices in the 
	  standard lists.  Added -rangeRate option and code to 
	  pick up start and end times from file, and correctly push 
	  them around to work with the DIGITS lists.  Also, now 
	  warns if extra stuff (e.g. unused ranges) are seen on 
	  lines of list file.
	- Added -firstutt and -nutts options to allow subsetting from 
	  a file list.  Quite slow to skip through several thousand 
	  list entries, because it executes the filecmd for each one 
	  anyway.
	- version now nominally 0.5

1998feb09 dpwe@icsi.berkeley.edu
	- Was still writing a debug file in OutputFile.C.  Removed
	- changed version (in configure.in) to 0.4 & made new release.

1998jan23 dpwe@icsi.berkeley.edu
CmdLineStuff.C:	In HandleCmdLine(), I was adding quotes around 
		args containing spaces, but not figuring those extra 
		chars into the space allocated, hence overrunning the 
		string buffer (turned up as a crash in cleSetDefaults, 
		which I guess was the next time alloc was called - but 
		only if the command line was *just* the right size.
1997nov05 dpwe
 - -list <listfile> becomes -list?s, a boolean indicating that the extra 
   filenames on the command line are lists of utids, not soundfiles.

1997oct16 dpwe
 - Made %u be the substitution token (for utid) in the filecmd (FileList.C)
   %s is still accepted too.  Man page (feacalc.man) fixed accordingly.
