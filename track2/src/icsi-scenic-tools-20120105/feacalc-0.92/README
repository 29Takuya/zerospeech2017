This is the README for the "feacalc" package. 

"feacalc" is a feature calculation package used to process audio files
for statistical pattern recognition research.

Much of the signal processing functionality is provided by the
"librasta" library from the "rasta" package.  See the feacalc(1) and
rasta(1) man pages for more description.  See the file "INSTALL" for
installation instructions.

feacalc was written by Dan Ellis although there have been
several other contributors.
